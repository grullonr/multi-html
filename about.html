        <h1> Introduction: </h1>
        <p> 
            It seems that you want to get to know me more, let me introduce myself. 
            <br> <br> 
            I am Rafael Grullon and I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at Lehman College. This Spring of 2023
            will be my last semester attending college and the reality of adulthood seems to be approaching but instead of 
            being worried, I am quite excited. 
            <br> <br>
            Now, you must be wondering: <em> but rafael, what do you like? </em>
            <br> <br>
            Well, good question! Personally, I love to write and code; if I do say so myself, code is like a mix between
            literature and science, it's like writing and creating at the same time and I enjoy that so much.

        <h1> What it means to be an engineer: </h1>

        <p> 
            To me, being an engineer means to be creative, logical and focused; with an open-mind for
            improvement and a certain artistic spin. In it's true essense, being an engineer is being a creator
            bringing an idea to life.
